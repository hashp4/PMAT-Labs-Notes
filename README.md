# PMAT Labs Notes by Enzo Saez - @hashp4 üî¨


This repository contains my personal notes and answers to the challenges from the Practical Malware Analysis & Triage course created by [@HuskyHacks](https://github.com/HuskyHacks). This is mainly for everyone following the course or just for people interested by the topic. Feel free to take a look. (:

## Learning Objectives

The following bulleted items are this course's Learning Objectives. It is split into two categories: **Conceptual Learning Objectives** (*what to understand*) and **Skill-based Learning Objectives** (*what to perform*).

### Conceptual Learning Objectives
```
- Explain the high-level malware analysis methodology.
- Explain safe malware handling and detonation procedures.
- Explain the importance of snapshots during malware analysis.
- Describe a high-level overview of a malware analysis lab network
- Identify safe sources for malware samples.
- Describe how the MITRE ATT&CK Framework informs malware analysis.
- Explain the differences between static and dynamic analysis.
- Explain the differences between basic and advanced analysis.
- Describe the differences between network indicators of compromise and host-based indicators of compromise.
- Explain the function of the IAT in a windows PE.
- Explain how the Windows API functions in a Windows PE.
- Explain the differences between high level languages and low level languages as they relate to malware analysis.
- Explain how decompilers & dissassemblers work.
- Explain the differences between source code, machine code, and assembly code.
- Describe the steps of a simple process injector at the Assembly and Windows API level.
- Explain the difference in .NET compiled binaries and Windows Portable Executables in relation to reverse engineering.
- Explain the differences in analysis & handling of different malware classes, i.e. maldocs, malscripts, PEs, DLLs, and process injectors.
- Explain how WMI can be used by malware.
```

### Skill-based Learning Objectives
```
- Create a local malware analysis lab with FLARE-VM and REMnux.
- Implement proper malware analysis network safety with segmentation of the malware analysis lab via Host Only or Internal networking.
- Implement internet simulation with INetSim within an isolated malware analysis lab network.
- Implement VM snapshots for safety and consistency during analysis.
- Handle malware from source to sink with an emphasis on safety.
- Perform controlled, safe malware detonation in a lab environment.
- Perform basic static analysis on Windows PEs, including: file hashing, analyzing PE strings, analyzing the Import Address Table, analyzing triage information with Capa, identifying and unpacking UPX packed malware.
- Match MITRE ATT&CK matrix items to malware capabilities.
- Perform basic dynamic analysis on Windows PEs, including: detonating and recording initial triage notes, examining network indicators of compromise with Wireshark, examining host-based indicators with Procmon, correlating network and host-based indicators of compromise between tools, analyzing the parent-child process relationships of malware programs.
- Perform advanced static analysis on Windows PEs, including: dissassembly & decompilation with Cutter, analyzing and interpreting i386 and AMD64 Assembly instructions, and analyzing a shellcode process injector at the Assembly level.
- Perform advanced dynamic analysis on Windows PEs, including: controlling flow of a program in a debugger, executing instructions, setting breakpoints, and patching instructions to alter program flow.
- Perform binary patching to alter the execution flow of a malware program.
- Identify and defeat anti-analysis techniques.
- Use Cyber Chef to transform data and decode a payload.
- Analyze malicious Microsoft Office documents.
- Analyze shellcode to determine its function.
- Analyze obfuscated PowerShell scripts.
- Analyze obfuscated VBScript.
- Analyze HTML Application files.
- Reverse-engineer a compiled .NET binary with dnSpy.
- Identify language patterns in compiled binaries
- Perform static analysis on an APK file with MobSF
- Combine all analysis methodologies and analyze a real world ransomware sample.
- Perform automated analysis with scripts and malware sandboxes.
- Compose YARA rules that identify malware program.
- Write & publish a malware analysis report.
```
